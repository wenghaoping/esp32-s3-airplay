/**
 * WiFi/BT coexistence coordinator.
 *
 * On ESP32 the single radio is shared between WiFi and Classic Bluetooth; the
 * coexistence arbiter throttles WiFi RX whenever the BT controller is enabled,
 * even when idle.  To give AirPlay full WiFi bandwidth this module suspends the
 * BT radio while AirPlay is actively streaming and resumes it after AirPlay has
 * been idle for a short settling delay.
 *
 * All BT radio suspend/resume operations are performed by a single owner task,
 * driven by an ordered event queue.  Callers only post events (from any task
 * context); the task serialises every transition, which removes the flag races
 * that plagued the earlier ad-hoc implementation.
