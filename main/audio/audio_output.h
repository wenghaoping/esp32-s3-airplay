/**
 * Priority of the playback task in every output backend.
 *
 * It MUST outrank every audio source task (realtime UDP receiver = 8,
 * control receiver = 7, buffered TCP reader = 5) because the source tasks
 * are pinned to the same core.  A source task that outranks playback starves
 * it during a receive burst; the DMA ring (~46 ms) then runs dry and
 * auto_clear emits silence, so wall-clock advances while no audio is
 * consumed and the playout position slips permanently late.  That was the
 * mechanism behind the realtime-stream drift in issue #122 — the buffered
 * path was unaffected only because its reader task sits at priority 5.
 *
 * Playback cannot starve the sources in return: it blocks on the DMA write
 * for all but a few hundred microseconds of each ~8 ms frame period.
